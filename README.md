# Summer-2020_NEW
A small journey into the quatum realm with python
This is a series of python scripts which can be used to solve the schoringer equation for bound one dimensional potentials, with the necessary tweaks.
The Schrodinger_Declutter and Support_Functions_Morse were needed for running the other codes. But in the newer releases these have been replaced by a single python script:support function
Schrodinger declutter was used for both QHO(Harmonic oscilator) and QDW(Potential well). Support_Functions_Morse was needed for the morse solver to excecute.
In the latest release all scripts can be ruhn using the support functions script.
